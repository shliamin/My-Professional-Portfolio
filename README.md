# Welcome to My Professional Journey
Hello! I'm thrilled to share my journey of continuous learning, achievements, and the pursuit of excellence that defines who I am, both professionally and personally. This repository is not just a collection of documents and certificates but a narrative of my life's work, passion, and dedication.

## My Beginnings

My journey began with an unwavering determination and a pursuit of success, a trait evident from my early days. A notable highlight was winning the **World Children's Karate Competition in Hannover**, a testament to my ability to overcome challenges and excel in competitive environments. This significant achievement laid the foundation for my future successes and showcased my resilience.

## Academic Excellence

My passion for learning was unmistakable in my school years, where I earned a **gold medal for outstanding academic achievements**, placing me among the top four students in my class. This early accolade was a precursor to my dedication to academia and self-improvement.

Pursuing language mastery led me to achieve a **C1 level in German** in just 8 months, a feat accomplished through intensive study and a deep engagement with German culture, films, and literature. This achievement demonstrated my linguistic capabilities and my ability to immerse myself fully in and adapt to new cultures and languages.

## Higher Education and Professional Development

My academic path continued with significant milestones, including my **admission to a college for foreign students** on my first attempt, amidst stiff competition. I excelled in mathematics and the German language, further fueling my academic ambitions.

I participated in an intensive **boot camp** at 'Le Wagon' in Berlin, where I contributed significantly to the development of the 'Nabo web application as part of an international team. Though the project didn't achieve commercial success, it underscored my teamwork, innovation, and technical prowess.

My education in electrical engineering at the Ruhr University Bochum deepened my passion for science and technology, particularly in mathematics and computer science. This passion culminated in earning a **Bachelor of Science degree** in Applied Computer Science from the University of Applied Sciences Berlin, where my **thesis work** was so impactful that I was asked to assist other students, showcasing my analytical abilities.

## Volunteer Work and Professional Competence

Beyond academic and technical achievements, I've demonstrated a strong commitment to altruism and community service, particularly through volunteering and providing shelter for refugees. This act of kindness underscores my values and willingness to help others.

My professional reliability and competence were further recognized during my internship at Rhenus Logistics. I received high praise and a **letter of recommendation**, reinforcing my professional standing and work ethic.
